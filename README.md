hello doctor abdallah,

for some reason when i try to do a post request, the response is in html type and not in the JSON
format i outlined. tried launching it in chrome and in android emulator and was still getting the same 
XMLHttpRequest error.

google says its an issue from the free hosting server since its using a 
security mechanism called JS Challenge which blocks direct requests 
from tools like Postman or non-browser environments, including Flutter.
